My first steps in CUDA

TODO:
 * Reduce:
  * shared memory in functions
  * function to fill data to next power of two with neutral element
  * better division for reducing big arrays
 * General:
  * adjust other GPU programs to get argument N from comandline parameter
  * add some time measurement
